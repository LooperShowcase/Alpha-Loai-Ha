        International chess Western chess Public chess tables in the Jardin du
        Luxembourg, Paris Chess is a board game for two players, called White
        and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces in their color, with
        the objective to checkmate the opponent's king. It is sometimes called
        international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related
        games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The
        recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a
        similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. The rules of chess
        as we know them today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century,
        with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th
        century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played
        by millions of people worldwide. Chess is an abstract strategy game that
        involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played
        on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At
        the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two
        rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first,
        followed by Black. The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king,
        i.e. threatening it with inescapable capture. There are also several
        ways a game can end in a draw. Organized chess arose in the 19th
        century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE
        (the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized
        World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Ding
        Liren is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has
        developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess
        composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art,
        and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer
        science, and psychology. One of the goals of early computer scientists
        was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the
        first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it
        defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly
        stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the
        development of chess theory; however, chess is not a solved game. This
        article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. Rules Main
        article: Rules of chess The rules of chess are published by FIDE
        (Fédération Internationale des Échecs; "International Chess
        Federation"), chess's world governing body, in its Handbook.[1] Rules
        published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess
        organizations, commercial publishers, etc., may differ in some details.
        FIDE's rules were most recently revised in 2023. Setup Initial position

        knight, rook; second row: pawns Setup at the start of a chess game Chess
        pieces are divided into two different colored sets. While the sets might
        not be literally white and black (e.g. the light set may be a yellowish
        or off-white color, the dark set may be brown or red), they are always
        referred to as "white" and "black". The players of the sets are referred
        to as White and Black, respectively. Each set consists of sixteen
        pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and
        eight pawns. Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles; for
        competition, the Staunton pattern is usually required. The game is
        played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks) and eight columns
        (called files). By convention, the 64 squares alternate in color and are
        referred to as light and dark squares; common colors for chessboards are
        white and brown, or white and dark green. The pieces are set out as
        shown in the diagram and photo. Thus, on White's first rank, from left
        to right, the pieces are placed in the following order: rook, knight,
        bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook. On the second rank is placed
        a row of eight pawns. Black's position mirrors White's, with an
        equivalent piece on the same file. The board is placed with a light
        square at the right-hand corner nearest to each player. The correct
        positions of the king and queen may be remembered by the phrase "queen
        on her own color" (i.e. the white queen begins on a light square, and
        the black queen on a dark square). In competitive games, the piece
        colors are allocated to players by the organizers; in informal games,
        the colors are usually decided randomly, for example by a coin toss, or
        by one player concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in
        the other, and having the opponent choose. Movement White moves first,
        after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except
        for castling, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an
        unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is
        captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant,
        all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece
        occupies. Movings
